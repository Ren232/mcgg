== Info for setting the Priority:

By changing the priority, you choose when ChatEX handles the chat.
The default value is LOWEST. this means, that it will be executed first.
There are currently five different Prioritys you can choose.
LOWEST, LOW, NORMAL, HIGH and HIGHEST.
LOWEST will be executed first and HIGHEST will be executed last.
If you have Multiverse-core enabled and want it to prefix the chat with the world-name,
you should set it to a low value.



== Multi-prefixes and -suffixes

!!!This feature is only available, if you have PermissionsEx installed!!!

If you have Multi-prefixes/suffixes enabled, the prefix will be set to the prefixes/suffixes of ALL groups the player is in.
Example:

You have two groups:
Owner and Moderator.

The prefix of Owner is '&4Owner ' and the prefix of Moderator is '&9Moderator '.
You are in the owner AND in the moderator group.
Your prefix in chat will be: '&4Owner &9Moderator '.
If you now have a special prefix only for you, it will be added to the prefix in chat, too.
